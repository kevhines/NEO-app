Near Earth Object (NEO) App

This app allows you to search for Asteroids that flew near Earth on any date. Enter a date and get a list of asteroids. You can also just view the 5 biggest or 5 closest asteroids. You can then choose any of the listed asteroids to see when it will next visit Earth.\n
Find an Asteroid that flew by on a important day (Wedding, Birth of a Child, Completion of your CLI Project for The Flatiron School) then see when it will come by again. That's your celestial anniversary!
